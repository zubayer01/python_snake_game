# python_snake_game
First attempt

A very Simple python Turtle absed graphical game Snake.

It is really interesting for me. I did it while i was doing my python course under Angela Yu.

Most of the codes are written by me. But there are also some simillarities as it was done by the inspiritaion of her work.
